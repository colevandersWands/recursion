stepps
	calling ones self
	- merge these
	bottoming out
	the four chunks + template
		analyze, chunk, refactor
	recursive iteration (linear)
	logging recursive functions
	branching recursion
	template final




cases to cover
	single args buildup
		palindrome
		mult, pow
	early turn-around
		- or treat this as a subset of multi-base-case?
		palindrome
	single base case
		mult, pow
	multi-base-case
		palindrome
	with mapping
		../05--sol-des/3--repo/4-recurse-it/mapping-and-recursion.js
	multi-arg build-up
		sorting 
		reversing
	multi-step break-down
		reversing
	cases that arent base but need handling
	recursive calls in looping
		ie tree searches
