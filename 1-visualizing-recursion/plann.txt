recursion is a strange new way of thinking
  it requires new way of thinking and trust in code

lo's
  manually solve recursive problems
  visualize the recursive process
    recursion is not iterative
    it is conceptually in parallel
  build trust with faith-cases
  be comfortable pulling out the components
  learn to think locally with confidence
    if the components work, the function works
    and if not, you can figure out where & why

exercises
  given a recursive definition & function
