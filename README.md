learning objectives
* a formal understanding of recursion
    * replacing recursive calls with known return values
    * manually solving in parallel steps
    * defining recursive functions in notation
* visualizing recursive solution trees with logging
* breaking down & labeling components of recursive solutions
* thinking 'locally' 
    * not trying to understand the whole recursive branching
    * reasoning instead about a single call and the 4 components therein
    * trusting the recursive call to do it's job
* building recursive solutions in a structured way
* light js call-stack
* dummy testing
